# about-me\
My name is Cayton Hornberger and I am a freshmen at Allegheny College. I grew up in Coatesville, Pa. and went to Coatesville Area Senior High School. Throughout high school, I ran cross country and track and field.

Before high school and in my early childhood, I raced race cars and continued till I went to college. I went to a local track and watched the races at age four. Then at four and half, I started practicing and at age five, I was racing. I raced quarter midgets from the start till age fourteen and then I raced mini cups from age fourteen till age seventeen. In my fifteen years of racing, I won three track points championships, a United States Auto Club (USAC) tri-track series, a Quarter Midgets of America (QMA) Eastern Grand National race, Buckeye indoor series championship, and many races in quarter midgets. In mini cups, I raced an indoor series, Arena Racing USA, (ARUSA) for one season and then I raced an outdoor series, Shenandoah Valley Scale Racing League, (SVSRL). I won most improved driver in ARUSA in 2014 and I won the points championship in 2015 for SVSRL. In the SVSRL series, I raced for one season and won four out of the eleven races and finished with in the top five in all the races.
